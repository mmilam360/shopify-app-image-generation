# ðŸš€ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button)
3. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Repository name**: `shopify-mockup-generator`
   - **Description**: `AI-powered product mockup generator Shopify Theme App Extension`
   - **Make it Public** (required for free Railway deployment)
   - **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shopify-mockup-generator.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Check that all files are there**:
   - `extensions/mockup-generator-block/` folder
   - `package.json` files
   - `shopify.app.toml`
   - All documentation files
   - `.gitignore`

## Step 4: Deploy to Railway

   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose `shopify-mockup-generator`
4. **Railway will automatically deploy** your app
5. **Get your app URL**: Railway provides a URL like `https://your-app.railway.app`

## Step 5: Configure Shopify Partners Dashboard

2. **Create new app**:
   - Click "Create app"
   - Choose "Create app manually"
   - Name: "Mockup Generator App"
   - App URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`
3. **Set redirect URLs**:

   - `https://your-app.railway.app/auth/shopify/callback`
4. **Copy your credentials**:
   - Client ID (API key)
   - Client secret

## Step 6: Update App Configuration

1. **Update `shopify.app.toml`** with your real Client ID:
   ```toml
   client_id = "your-actual-client-id-here"
   application_url = "https://your-app.railway.app"
   ```

2. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add shopify.app.toml
   git commit -m "Update app configuration with real credentials"
   git push
   ```

3. **Railway will automatically redeploy**

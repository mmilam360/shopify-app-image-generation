# üåê Alternative Tunneling Solutions

Since ngrok is being blocked by Windows Defender, here are several alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Use Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)

Cloudflare Tunnel is more reliable and less likely to be blocked:

1. **Download Cloudflare Tunnel**:
   - Go to https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases
   - Download `cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe`
   - Rename it to `cloudflared.exe`

2. **Run the tunnel**:
   ```cmd
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Copy the URL** (will look like `https://random-words.trycloudflare.com`)

## Option 2: Use serveo.net (Web-based)

This is a simple web-based tunneling service:

1. **Open Command Prompt**
2. **Run this command**:
   ```cmd
   ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 serveo.net
   ```

3. **Copy the URL** provided

## Option 3: Use localhost.run

Another web-based solution:

1. **Open Command Prompt**
2. **Run this command**:
   ```cmd
   ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 localhost.run
   ```

## Option 4: Use Shopify CLI with Manual App Creation

Let's create your app properly in the Partners Dashboard first:

1. **Go to**: https://partners.shopify.com/
2. **Create a new app**:
   - Click "Create app"
   - Choose "Create app manually"
   - Name: "Image Generation App"
   - App URL: We'll set this after getting a tunnel

3. **Get your credentials**:
   - Copy the Client ID (API key)
   - Copy the Client secret

4. **Update your app configuration**:
   - Edit `shopify.app.toml`
   - Replace `your-client-id-here` with your actual Client ID

## Option 5: Use a Different Computer/VM

If all else fails:
- Use a different computer
- Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Use a cloud VM (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)

## Quick Test with Cloudflare Tunnel

Let's try Cloudflare Tunnel first as it's the most reliable:

1. **Download**: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe
2. **Rename**: `cloudflared.exe`
3. **Run**: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`
4. **Copy the URL** and use it in Shopify Partners Dashboard

## Next Steps

Once you have a working tunnel URL:

1. **Update your environment**:
   ```bash
   SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-tunnel-url.com
   ```

2. **Configure Shopify Partners Dashboard**:
   - App URL: `https://your-tunnel-url.com`
   - Redirect URLs: `https://your-tunnel-url.com/api/auth/callback`

3. **Test your app**: Visit the tunnel URL

Your server is running on `http://localhost:3000` - any of these tunneling solutions should work!

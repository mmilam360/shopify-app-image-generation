# ðŸš€ Shopify App Setup Guide

Congratulations! Your Shopify Image Generation App is now set up and running locally. Here's what we've accomplished and what you need to do next:

## âœ… What's Already Done

1. **Shopify CLI Installed** - You're authenticated with your Partners account
2. **App Structure Created** - All necessary files are in place
3. **Dependencies Installed** - All required packages are installed
4. **Server Running** - Your app is running on `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps: Connect to Shopify Partners Dashboard

### Step 1: Create Your App in Partners Dashboard

1. Go to [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com/)
2. Click **"Apps"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create app"**
4. Choose **"Create app manually"**
5. Fill in the details:
   - **App name**: "Image Generation App" (or your preferred name)
   - **App URL**: We'll set this up with ngrok in the next step

### Step 2: Set Up ngrok for Local Development

Since Shopify needs to access your local app from the internet, we need to use ngrok:

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **Start ngrok** in a new terminal window:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Copy the ngrok URL** (it will look like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### Step 3: Configure Your App in Partners Dashboard

1. Go back to your app in the Partners Dashboard
2. In the **"App setup"** section, set:
   - **App URL**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io`
   - **Allowed redirection URLs**: 
     - `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/auth/callback`
     - `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/auth/shopify/callback`

3. **Copy your credentials**:
   - **Client ID** (API key)
   - **Client secret** (API secret key)

### Step 4: Update Your Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```bash
   # Copy from env.example and fill in your actual values
   SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_actual_client_id_here
   SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
   SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
   SCOPES=write_products,read_products
   SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret_here
   ```

2. **Restart your server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   node server.js
   ```

### Step 5: Test Your App

1. **Install the app on a development store**:
   - In Partners Dashboard, go to **"Test on development store"**
   - Choose a development store or create one
   - Click **"Install app"**

2. **Verify the installation**:
   - Your app should open in the Shopify admin
   - You should see the "Image Generation App" interface

## ðŸŽ¯ Current App Features

Your app currently has:
- âœ… **Home page** with app information
- âœ… **Admin panel** for app management
- âœ… **Health check endpoint** for monitoring
- âœ… **Shopify authentication** setup
- âœ… **Basic UI** with modern styling

## ðŸ”® Next Development Steps

Once your app is connected to Shopify, you can:

1. **Add image generation functionality**
2. **Create product integration features**
3. **Build bulk processing capabilities**
4. **Add custom styling options**

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Cannot connect to server"**
   - Make sure ngrok is running
   - Check that your server is running on port 3000
   - Verify the ngrok URL in your Partners Dashboard

2. **"Invalid redirect URL"**
   - Double-check the redirect URLs in Partners Dashboard
   - Make sure they match your ngrok URL exactly

3. **"Missing API credentials"**
   - Verify your `.env` file has the correct API key and secret
   - Restart your server after updating `.env`
